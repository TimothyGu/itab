==CHANGES RELEASED 10.25.12==

	- Hi/Lo calculations on British Parliamentary are corrected

	- WUDC ballot entry alphabetized on the right

	- Judges were being assigned duplicate judge codes within a tournament;
	  this was preventing the next-judge function from working.  Fixed. (Sloat)

	- Changing the entry's name was leading to extra space and weird
	  ampersands.  Fixed.

	- Changed About to Help/About on the front page 

	- Congress bill packets were not posting; fixed now. (Deveau)

	- Events with more than 3 entries were not enterable by tourn admins; fixed
	  (Deveau)

	- Cumulative sweepstakes scores based on prelim ranks (KY/Allender/Cecil)

	- Prefs now can be viewed (but not changed) after the pref entry deadline (Reed)

	- Prefs can now open before the judge entry deadline has passed; the system
	  now only warns that bloodshed may ensue, but permits it.

	- Tabroom can now display WUDC/British Parliamentary results and take in
	  ballot input.
