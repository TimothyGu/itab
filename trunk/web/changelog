	- Added TouchPunch support which should make the menus and drag and drop
	  functions work better on touch devices such as iPads and smartphones.  (I
	  haven't been able to extensively test this as I do not have an iPad or
	  iPhone.  It works pretty well in Android).

	- Added the ability to text or email blast by section; if you click on the
	  room or judges from a single section of speech or debate, and click over
	  on the right on "text/email blast this section", you can send a message
	  that will be accompanied by the pairing for that round to a single
	  section's debaters and judges, if you have a room move or judge change or
	  something.

	- Award ceremony printout will bear a warning when there are ballots still
	  pending entry in that event.

	- Fixed a bug where hired judges were not being given judging assignments
	  by the mass paneler.

	- Fixed a bug with online ballot entry that marked all the tags for results
	  as blank and thus, y'know, didn't work.

	- Fixed a timezone bug with standing school fees.

	- Fixed an issue with the IE snake in elims, and added another option to
	  swap/protect for schools among students with the same 1st tiebreaker
	  score in addition to the current option where students who are less than
	  2 seeds apart are swapped.

	- Fixed the school code generator to better handle "University of" style
	  school names so their short-name codes didn't always end up being
	  "UniOf".

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.2.13==

	- Added a feature where if a strike/conflict gets duplicated many many
	  times, deleting just one of them will delete all identical ones.

	- Added the ability to add coach notes or special jobs, together with ADA
	  restrictions, to tournament-entered judges as they're entered.

	- Judges entered on the tournament director's side of things will retain
	  their links to their accounts; this was not working before.

	- Fixed a bug where a entry whose account is also a judge (say a college
	  debater who is also a high school judge) would cause many repeating
	  conflicts to be entered against any judge in a tournament who does not
	  have a linked account.

	- Happy 2013


==CHANGES RELEASED 12.20.12==

	- Fixed a few bugs where the numbers of judge hire requests were not being
	  reported; instead it was reporting the number of schools requesting
	  judges.

	- There is now a "results" tab when you log into your team's tabroom
	  account.  Under it you can find past tournament rosters, full results for
	  IE students, past invoices for reference, judges, etc. 

	  Debate results & ballot access are next up in the hopper here.

	- Fixed a bug where generating results meant reporting them publicly
	  whether or not you wanted to

	- Fixed a bug where the generation of results would not obey the "All"
	  setting.

	- Spiffed up the reports for results to display better

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.15.12==

	  now works

	- The rounds are now reverse sorted in the event results display and will
	  automatically show you the results from the latest completed round

	- Added ballots the event result display in the results menu

	- Made it so public pairings will automatically go to the latest posted
	  round rather than making you click again to go there.

	- Restored room counts to the Entries -> Reports -> Total Counts report.

	- Fixed a bug where if a round was not assigned to a site it would give you
	  this totally random list of rooms that came from God knows where.

	- Restored support for pairing Student Congress.  Congress rounds are
	  paired for prelim support only.  It will pair rooms and repeat the same
	  pairings for each prelim session.  Congress is not yet supported for
	  tabbing or breaking to finals.

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.13.12==

	- Fixed a bug where not all double entries were showing up on the double
	  entry report.

	- IE events can now publish round by round results just like the debaters

	  and see their total record.

	- Round by round results and individual prelim records for debaters using
	  the live updates feature are now also under the Results tab, not the
	  Postings tab, which in turn has been renamed to the Pairings tab.  this
	  will hopefully reduce clutter

	- The Results tab on the main website will now show past tournaments which
	  have published results or posted files.

	- Preliminary infrastructure in place to publish results on the public
	  website.  You can now publish IE results on the site and a "results" tab
	  will appear.  You can upload PDF files to post results for any event or
	  for the tournament as a whole.  You can generate results and make them
	  public on an event-by-event basis.  this is all under the Results -> 
	  Web Publish tab.  
	  
	  Even for posted PDF/file results, The event that a given file falls under
	  has to be marked "Public" or else the result will not be posted.

	  Coming next will be support for publicly posting sweepstakes scores,
	  debate results, congress results, and calculating things like bids/quals.

	- Tournament public website informational pages, such as the list of events
	  and user-created pages, are now visible under the "Main" tab instead of
	  bleeding over off the page as before.

	- Added state counts to the Stats report under Reports -> totals

	- Fixed a bug where the CSV download didn't show judges needing housing

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.08.12==

	- Free strikes support.  You can designate judges under Entries -> Judges
	  at "Free Strikes" over on the right as Free Strikes.  If they are so
	  designated they will not count against quotas for Tiered Prefs or School
	  or Entry Strikes; good for judges who are tabbing or are late adds to the
	  pref sheet or something like that.

	- Awards ceremony printout will now work for events that do not break to a
	  final round (MFL), and will skip events not directly tabbed in tabroom
	  (congress or debate).

	- Students can now enter their own pref sheets, provided that they have a
	  Tabroom account linked to their student record, and the school is set to
	  allow it.  Schools can allow it under the Settings tab when they first
	  log in, and checking the box next to "Entries may enter their own prefs"

	- Students can now enter standing conflicts against judges

	- School conflicts now carry over from students

	- Fixed a formatting bug on the events listing page

	  have schoolname/initial codes

	- Fixed a bug where all reports for a given tournament would not print
	  (Albert/MFL)

	- Waitlist and entry rosters will show how many confirmed entries each
	  school has now to help with the waitlist's management.

	- Fixed a bug that produced HORRENDOUS output for the codebreaker printout
	  if you were not using short numeric codes.

	- Fixed a bug that would not let you email all schools with entries still
	  marked TBA.

	- Fixed a bug that would not let you do school strikes without coach ratings.

	- Fixed a bug affecting certain types of master ballot printouts

	- Account holders can enter permanent conflicts against schools.  This
	  works only for account holders who judge; entries cannot conflict
	  themselves from being judged by an entire school's roster of judges
	  (because that is very rarely what is wanted).

	- Account holders can enter permanent conflicts against other account
	  holders for personal conflicts.  This only works for judges & entries
	  that are linked to an account; entries and judges not linked to accounts
	  will not have their conflicts carry over.

	  the side-agreement code is now changed to require re-entry for any judge
	  that got the sides backwards.

	  stripped out of their names


==CHANGES RELEASED 11.21.12==

	- Fixed the installer script to actually, y'know, work. 

	- The "Enter Ranks/Results" button on the Panel view will now allow the
	  tournament administrator to adjust ranks & results for debate, not just
	  speech.  This method contains no double checks or auditing, so is
	  intended for spot-entry corrections only; not for bulk entry (yet), which
	  will be available under Tabulation -> Enter Ballots once it's ready.

	- Panel view will now correctly show sides of debaters where before it only
	  showed information about IE competitors

	- Users can now edit the flight of a flighted debate round by clicking on
	  the room or judge and using the pull down on the right hand side above
	  the room selector.

	  when not using the online balloting system.

	  CSV of a debate division's NDCA qualifying points. (Me. Yes, Me.)

	- Added a feature that allows judges to enter into two groups; you can
	  permit judges in one pool to count for another (for say a swing
	  tournament where one pool is Friday and the other Saturday). (Diablo
	  Valley)

	- Fixed an error where advancing into an elimination round in IE would not
	  permit you to advance into a round where there were no pre-set panels,
	  thus creating duplicate elim rounds etc.  (Maine, Jersey).

	- A circuit can now download its contact database into an Excel sheet on
	  the circuit management page off the homepage. (Mass)

	- Explained the event entry deadline a little better. (Everyone and their
	  uncle).

	- Added a "roundrobin" type for the Event Type.  Mostly useful for the CAT.

	- Added a "level" setting to the events; this is mostly going to be useful
	  for calculation of NDT points and won't be useful for others.

	- Adjust Labels now show reasonable defaults so if you change them and
	  break them you know how to put them back.  Amanda.

	  a judge roster.

	- Fixed a bug where hitting the back button after paneling the judges en
	  masse for a group would re-panel them.  Mayhem ensued in Maine.

	- The "Break Event" links on the ballot entry screen were broke.  Fixed
	  'em.

	- Printable listing of schools entered in a given division ( Entries ->
	  Events -> List Schools By Event on the right).

	- Report which tracks which schools are not checked in by event (Entries ->
	  Reports -> onsite status)

	- Restored judge, student and entry dance cards (Vaughan).
	
	- Restored the paper ballot table checkin report (Vaughan).

	- Fixed an issue that was causing college tournametns to pair speech events
	  in a Highly Weird Manner. (Diablo Valley)

	- Tweaked the pairings menu to sort by event type and then event name.

==CHANGES RELEASED 11.8.12==

	- Added a tweak where schools with judges but no entries would still
	  download in the XML download system.

	- School administrators can de-duplicate student records by clicking on
	  De-duplicate on the right hand side of the Students tab for their team.

	- Students with accounts linked to their student record can now see their
	  upcoming rounds and results for the current tournament, as well as being
	  able to go backwards and see past tournaments, right from their tabroom
	  homepage.

	  grouped and esp for elims this should be much less confusing.  It is
	  however a bit slower as a result.

	  rate extra 2s, fewer 4s means extra 3s, etc) if the tournament setting
	  for it is enabled under Setup->Judges->Ratings.

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.31.12==
	
	Happy Halloween!

	- CAT API adapted to add minimum points, and to put placeholders in place
	  of null values because .NET throws a fit with nulls for some reason.

	- Unbalanced round tabs looked unselected; now they do not.

	- Fixed an issue where a multi-judge prelim panel would not show up for all
	  but one judge on the judge master chart.

	  of kicking an error message

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.25.12==

	- Hi/Lo calculations on British Parliamentary are corrected

	- WUDC ballot entry alphabetized on the right

	- Judges were being assigned duplicate judge codes within a tournament;
	  this was preventing the next-judge function from working.  Fixed. (Sloat)

	- Changing the entry's name was leading to extra space and weird
	  ampersands.  Fixed.

	- Changed About to Help/About on the front page 

	- Congress bill packets were not posting; fixed now. (Deveau)
