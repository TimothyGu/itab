	- 

	- Improved results display for debate on the public site; each panel is
	  grouped and esp for elims this should be much less confusing.  It is
	  however a bit slower as a result.

	- School roster of entries defaults to a full listing again

	- Master ballots were not printing double entry asterisks; fixed. 

	- Master ballots were printing weird characters with the ballot messages;
	  this is now fixed

	- Under Register-> Emails you can now email all coaches in your tournament
	  who have TBA entries to remind them to put in judge names.

	- Under Register -> Data Maniuplation there is now a way to either drop or
	  delete all entries from your tournament marked as TBA entries.

	- Fixed a bug where coach admins added by a site administrator were
	  prefs-only

	- Preference sheets will now cumulate ranks (If you rank fewer 3s you can
	  rate extra 2s, fewer 4s means extra 3s, etc) if the tournament setting
	  for it is enabled under Setup->Judges->Ratings.

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.31.12==
	
	Happy Halloween!

	- CAT API adapted to add minimum points, and to put placeholders in place
	  of null values because .NET throws a fit with nulls for some reason.

	- Unbalanced round tabs looked unselected; now they do not.

	- Fixed an issue where a multi-judge prelim panel would not show up for all
	  but one judge on the judge master chart. 

	- Put in a warning when there are no active tiebreakers to set some instead
	  of kicking an error message

	- Restored the "visual-audit" and "no-audit" ballot entry methods.

	- Removed fines that were copying across badly.

	- TRPC XML uploads would clobber student names; fixed;

	- Error message notifier would not allow you to click on search box when
	  it was visible; fixed

	- The search box would sometiems produce a really odd ARRAY error; fixed;

	- Attempting to panel 2 judges in a panel would not work; now it does.

	- The judge printout in registration is now fixed.

	- You can now approve judge hire requests right from the school entry
	  screen.

	- Top Novices & Honorable Mentions are restored and will show on the awards
	  ceremony report for IE events.

	- The schematic display will now automatically show the first round which
	  has outstanding ballots, and the results display will automatically show
	  the results for the last completed round.

	- Manual panel editing for results is now restricted to accounts with 
	  setup access.

	- Put in filtering for the tournament name and entry to prevent a 
	  potential cross site scripting attack

	- School reports are now available from the Results -> Reports screen
	  though they are rather excruiciatingly slow at the moment.



==CHANGES RELEASED 10.25.12==

	- Hi/Lo calculations on British Parliamentary are corrected

	- WUDC ballot entry alphabetized on the right

	- Judges were being assigned duplicate judge codes within a tournament;
	  this was preventing the next-judge function from working.  Fixed. (Sloat)

	- Changing the entry's name was leading to extra space and weird
	  ampersands.  Fixed.

	- Changed About to Help/About on the front page 

	- Congress bill packets were not posting; fixed now. (Deveau)

	- Events with more than 3 entries were not enterable by tourn admins; fixed
	  (Deveau)

	- Cumulative sweepstakes scores based on prelim ranks (KY/Allender/Cecil)

	- Prefs now can be viewed (but not changed) after the pref entry deadline (Reed)

	- Prefs can now open before the judge entry deadline has passed; the system
	  now only warns that bloodshed may ensue, but permits it.

	- Tabroom can now display WUDC/British Parliamentary results and take in
	  ballot input.
