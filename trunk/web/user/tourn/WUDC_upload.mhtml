<h4>WUDC "results only" upload page</h4>
This page allows the upload of a tournament for which there are final rankings but no individual student entries and no round information.  The .xml files for upload are generated off of Colm Flynn's database.  If you are not named Colm Flynn, Jon Bruschke, or Chris Palmer, this pages is probably not for you.  Otherwise, go ahead and identify the file below.<hr>
