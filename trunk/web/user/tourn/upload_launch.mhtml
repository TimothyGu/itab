<h2>Upload any tournament to the database</h2>

Our goal is to allow any tournament using any tabulation software to be able to upload results to the master tabroom databse.  This will allow your points to be counted toward the iHonors point system and makes your results searchable and sortable; you should not need to post your cumulative results sheets anywhere else.  Here's how:

<h4>Upload from the CAT</h4>

You have 2 options:<br>
1) From the main CAT page, click the button that says "Upload to Web."  You're done.<<br>
2) If you hit a snag or want to upload through the website, log in, navigate to the Director's page, and then select Entry->Manipulate Data and click the button in the right-hand column that says "Import XML."

<h4>Upload from TRPC</h4>

First you need to create the XML file; click Results->Main Results Printout->Print Packet results.  Click blue button in the middle of the screen that says "Click here to create a Universal Data Structure file."  There is now a file in your TRPCDATA folder called TourneyData.xml.

If you did NOT use tabroom to take entries, click <a href="request.mhtml">here</a><br>
If you did use tabroom for tournament registration,  log in, navigate to the Director's page, and then select Entry->Manipulate Data and click the button in the right-hand column that says "Import XML."<br>
