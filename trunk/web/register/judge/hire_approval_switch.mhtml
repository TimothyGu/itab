	This is an automated email to inform you that 

	$tourn_name

	has approved you to offer $rounds rounds of hired judging
	in $group_name.

	If a school wishes to hire you, they will contact you by the email in your
	Tabroom account.  You will recieve another email once a school hires you
	within Tabroom.

	If you want to cancel your offered rounds, log into your Tabroom account
	and go to
