If the speaker awards are not appearing in the correct order, it is more than likely the case that he tiebreakers in iDebateTabroom 
are not the same as those used in the offline tabulation software.  The fix is quite easy, and can be done by the tournament director.</br></br>

If the problem does not seem to be the tiebreakers, but appears to be a calculation problem, email me at jbruschke@gmail.com</br></br>
