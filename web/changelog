	- Re-added the top bar (with one's name and logout buttons) in tournament 
	management mode. 

	- Fixed a bug where entering a time based strike without entering the actual
	time sent me annoying error email.  Now the time based strike has a default
	time entered. 


==CHANGES RELEASED 11.8.11==

	- Cleaned up the interface behind exporting to TRPC and TRIE.  I removed a
	  lot of unused options that literally haven't been used for years.  I also
	  added the ability to export simple conflicts & strikes through the MJP
	  system (import it as if it were MJP, and conflicts will be 5s, strikes
	  will be 6s, and everyone else will be 1s).  Conflicts are also now pulled
	  into ordinary MJP as strikes.  (Before they had to be 1s). 

	- Fixed numerous little bugs that likely were caused by the last release, or
	  at least unveiled by it. 

	- Cleaned up the hire entry and judge entry interface under registration.


==CHANGES RELEASED 10.9.11==

	- Major changes to the setup section.  Layout is different, some unused
	  options are deleted, etc.  Hopefully things are clearer & easier to use,
	  particularly creating new events.

	- New system for rating judges.  The new system means that a new scale and
	  rating system can be used for each judge group, not one for the whole
	  tournament.  So if you wanted a different rating system for Congress vs
	  IE vs Debate, or different MJP scales for Policy vs LD, you can now do
	  that.

	- Beginnings of debate paneling & tabulation support.  For now there are
	  mostly hooks and indications, not actual support, but I've made some
	  changes under the hood that will enable further progress.

	- By the end of the weekend I'll have live update support for debate events
	  so you can post, email out and text message out updates to judges and
	  competitors with their pairings and assignments.  

	- Other little cosmetic changes.  Please let me know if something you need
	  has broken.  I have tested the changes as extensively as I know how but
	  it's impossible to test every possible combination of settings and rules.


===CHANGES RELEASED 1.23.11===

1.23

	- Changed the front page.  Moved the news & info which is of little use to
	  anyone to an About page linked off the top.  Widened the upcoming
	  tournament listings so that tournament names fit better, and moved it to
	  the center.   Filled the space at right with a listing of tournaments
	  with recently published results in backwards chronlogical order.

	- Added the missing script that allows tournaments to publish lists of
	  clearing competitors for a given elim without posting full schematics
	  under Setup -> Website (Vaughan, me).

	- Fixed a bug where printing was impossible for events results sheets for
	  tournaments that were based only on final rounds. (WACFL).

	- Fixed a bug preventing the entry of dues payments. (MFL)

	- Fixed a bug where tournaments disappered from the tabroom listing in a
	  user account on the last day of the tournament.  Now there is a couple
	  day grace period before a tournament will go away so tournament directors
	  can clear up last minute things.   (MFA, MFL)

	- Added a link on the chapter edit screen within the league administrator's
	  section so they can change membership types for their members. (MFL)

	- Added a "headcount" report so you can view & print the number of actual
	  people (not entries) per school.  (Kahn)

	- Put numbers of entries & judges into the tabs on the reg screen (Kahn)

	- Added a tab to the main page for league dues.  The tab will appear only
	  if the school is a member of a league with dues, and will turn red if
	  those dues are unpaid/pending.  Chapters can download dues invoices from
	  this screen for the current year, and also print reciepts for all
	  previous dues payments.  This feature will only work for leagues that
	  have designated a dues-payment contact in their league settings under
	  Dues.  (MFL)


1.19
	
	- Added a feature where schools can view their invoices from the results
	  page.

	- Added a feature where schools can download their own school IE reports
	  from the results page.


===CHANGES RELEASED 12.28.10===

12.27	

	- New registration interface.  Much fixing of bugs involved.


12.15	

	- Tournaments can now alter the information and website that registrants
	  and others get to when they click on the tournament on the main
	  tabroom.com site.  Control is under Setup -> Website.  Field reports,
	  special postings, and lists of clearing finalists/semifinalists are also
	  on this control.


12.10

	- Cleaned up the interface to join and leave leagues.

	- Put a crossbox on the initial screen to remove tournaments you're
	  not interested in.


===CHANGES RELEASED 9.19.10====

9.19.10

	- Patriots lose to the Jets.  Universe trembles, possibly ending soon. 

	- Added a hopefully more intuitive and definitely more visually clean
	  tabbed interface to the registration screens within a tournament. 

	- Added a total-counter to the MJP preferencing system so people can see
	  where they are. 

	- Added a warning screen when people are about to drop an entry in a time
	  period where they can't re-add the kid (if the event is waitlisted, or
	  it's past the add deadline, or something of that nature).

	- Dropping a kid now also drops the housing attached to that kid, after a
	  suitable warning. 

9.10.10
	
	- Fixed a bug with editing the student roster (ticket #1548);

	- The process when someone first creates a tabroom.com account now features
	  clearer instructions and a walk-through so I don't get more critical
	  emails from new coaches angry that my freely provided service isn't up to
	  their standards.  Not that I'm bitter.

	- The league joining screen is considerably cleaned up.  I kinda hated the
	  old one and it was a frequent point of confuson for new users. 

	- Added in a feature where you will no longer see the error screens as a
	  user.  When an error occurs, you will instead see an explanatory screen,
	  and the error message will instead be automatically logged into my bug
	  tracking system where I, the only human in the world to whom those error
	  messages mean anything, can deal with them immediately.


9.09.10

	- Fixed a bug that was causing automatically school fees to not apply
	  correctly all the time.

9.08.10

	- Fixed a bug where school codes were not auto-generated when using the
	  auto-increment method.

9.07.10

	- Added in manual adjustment of the size of ballot labels.  Click the link
	  next to where you print ballot labels to mess around with label
	  dimensions to suit your individual printer & PDF software.


===CHANGES RELEASED 9.06.10====

9.06.10

	- Yeah, so i've been terrible at keeping up with the changelog.  It's been
	  a fun year.  There have indeed been changes over the last 16 months.  The
	  highlights include these, which have been rolled out up to and including
	  today:

	- Schematics uses a tabbed interface which is easier to navigate.

	- Setting up a pre-prepared elim round is done directly on the schemtic
	  now.

	- It is now possible to edit the MFL Standard Events screens from the
	  League Administrator's page; before I did this in the database by hand
	  which was Not Much Fun, let me tell you.

	- User editable public websites with a tabbed interface.  Edit on
	  Setup->Website in the tournament director's side.  You can add pages,
	  content, and postings.

	- Users can request tournaments of league administrators directly within
	  Tabroom.com; no need any longer for the league admin to enter the
	  information themselves.

	- Postings are fancier and PDF files can be uploaded to them so TRPC
	  postings or whatever can be included in the fun.

	- The main page also has a tabbed interface that thus far has proven much
	  easier for people who are familiar with Tabroom to navigate and much
	  harder for newbies to do so.  There will likely be a first-timer's
	  induction thing added shortly to help the new folks along.

6.24.09

	- Mostly completed the new preferencing system.  Added some new prefs:

		- Different fines for elim and prelim round no show judges.

		- Some stuff involving debaters speaker codes

		- Mutual preferencing and community preferencing.


6.15.09	
	
	- One bigass set of changes:

		- New interface in the menubars that allows for submenus.

		- Broke up schematics so they can be pulled by round, not just the
		  whole event

		- Broke up settings into a series of smaller screens with more
		  explanations thereof

		- Cleaned up the rooms entry and management interface to allow easy
		  uploading from text files, quality settings, marking rooms inactive
		  instead of deleting them, and entering notes & capacity markings

		- Cleaned up the entry of rooms pools into events somewhat.

		- The schedule can now be edited overall; it doesn't have to be changed
		  round by round, which could get annoying REAL fast.

		- Added some settings for the beginnings of the Super Duper Judge
		  Community Ratings and Mutual Preferencing systems.

		- Added more explanations as to what these settings all, yknow, mean.

===CHANGES RELEASED 5.17.09====

5.19.09
	
	- Coded a bunch of aesthetic changes in the cards etc.  Coded in more
	  escapes to prevent the damned Thomas Jefferson High School of Science
	  and Technology from causing an entire print run to fail just because
	  their school name is 44 frigging letters long.

	- Enabled the new security model; each account can now only log in
	  once at a time; if the account logs in elsewhere, the other sessions
	  are expired. 

	- Enabled new "entry only" access to tournaments; logging into a 
	  tournament only gives a person access to the data entry screen, not
	  to the tournament as a whole.

===CHANGES RELEASED 5.17.09====

5.17.09

	- Coded in the NCFL Diocesan Sweeps awards, both this year and cumulative.
	- Ran dry runs with fake debate data and checked by hand, all is clear.

5.16.09

	- Coded in support to download NCFL Speech only school sweeps into CSV.
	- Coded in support to download NCFL Debate only school sweeps into CSV.
	- Coded in support to download NCFL Masteron sweeps into CSV.

	- Coded in support to print NCFL Speech only school sweeps
	- Coded in support to print NCFL Debate only school sweeps 
	- Coded in support to print NCFL Masteron sweeps results

5.15.09

	- Coded in support to download NCFL Speech only school sweeps results into
	CSV.

5.14.09

	- Coded in support for the NCFL sweeps framework in general.

	- Added in support to calculate the Founder's Trophy in Speech Team
	Results.  Results matched with previous years' tournament data.

	- Added in support to upload Joy of Tournaments debate data and auto-score
	debate win/loss records into the sweepstakes system.

	- Broke down the manual input of sweepstakes points entries to allow folks
	to enter points one event at a time, instead of all non speech events
	happening at once.  Also allowed the sorting of the manual entry by
	various fields, and added in support to auto-advance the cursor once
	sweeps points were entered.

5.12.09	

	- Coded in an exception such that no one will get judge or speaker code
	666 or 69 anymore. Let's have SOME maturity here, folks.

5.11.09

	- Added reports for judge pools under Panel->Judges; you can print out and
	view the counts of the number of judges in each pool, and also view the
	roster of the actual judges in the pools as well.

5.10.09

	- Many an NCFL bug was here slain.

5.8.09

	- Added a function called "Shenanigans" underneath the Register menu which
	checks for several of the antisocial behaviors that forensics coaches
	frequently try to pull against tournaments.  For now it checks for a judge
	entered twice; more to come.

4.21.09

	- Fixed change logging to also track changes for the NCFL. 
	
	- Fixed a problem with snaking and adjusting for schools among similar
	cumes which would result in unbalanced panels.

	- Fixed a flaw with the option to force school-balanced panels no matter
	what which would not place students in panels at all and leave you with
	blank panels. 

4.19.09
	
	- Took out that annoying black bar from the invoices when an invoice is
	fully paid.

	- Added support to enter a supplement event for the NYSFL's Impromptu.
	Supplemental entries can only be students already entered in the
	tournament, and the system does not support pre-registering of supp
	entries; entries can only be entered at the time of the tournament. 

3.25.09
	
	- Added support for non-NCFL tournaments to ask for ADA requirements.  You
	have to check in the registry entry list, though, it doesn't export into
	TRPC's comment fields, since I haven't figured out how to reverse engineer
	that part. 
	  

===CHANGES RELEASED 3.20.09====

3.19.09

	- Fixed a flaw that event flights (used for double entry tracking) 
	  could not be deleted, only added.  (Ticket #529);

	- Fixed a bug that didn't permit change logs to be cleared sometimes 
	  (Ticket #607).

	- Dropped entries no longer trigger double-entry limits (Ticket #605).

	- Fixed a flaw (Ticket #606) where people with league admin powers
	  and not tournament admin powers could not enter new competitors or
	  save details.  I fixed this despite the fact that it was annoying
	  Jon Cruz.

	- Added support for a limited cap in NCFL Nationals where a diocese
	  only is obligated to sign up for 2x as many elim rounds as their
	  judge quota; since percentage obligations break down on the lower
	  end of the judge scale.

	- Changed the colors of highlighted table entries to get rid of that
	  hideous green-blue in favor of a much more pleasant and less
	  clashing pale-blue.  I don't know what I was thinking.

3.15.09
	
	- Fixed a flaw where republishing a single event's results would
	  blank out the entire index of the event's results. 

	- Added support to upload other files for non tabroom tabbed events
	  into the public results sheets under Results->Publish.

3.13.09

	- Speeded up the reporting of results and school reports at the end
	  of the day

	- Added results & final overall rankings to the school-results
	  sheets.

3.11.09

	- Added support for NCFL registrants to designate an entry as needing ADA
	  compliant accomodations.  This only works for NCFL registrations for now.

===CHANGES RELEASED 3.10.09====

3.10.09	
	
	- Added support to drop the best and/or the worst prelim, elim,
	  and final ballot, not simply the worst or the best overall.
	  Set these settings in Setup->Settings under Tabulation.

3.06.09
	
	- Added, thanks to the new judgemath engine, the ability for
	  tournament directors to give credit to a school for a judge who
	  actually judges in a different category, without playing invoice
	  games.  Thus if someone brings extra LD judges to cover for a PF
	  slot, you can go into the judge and select "PF" under the "Counts
	  For" menu.  The judge will be assigned into the LD pool when it
	  comes to paneling, but will count as a PF judge when it comes to
	  registration.

	- Added a way under Panel -> Set Schedules to see rounds by timeslot
	  as well as by event.

3.03.09	
	
	- Changed the judge math engine in both preregistration and
	  registration functions to use the same bit of code, so they would
	  not longer get into fights with one another as to how many judges
	  were owed.

	- Fixed a flaw that would cause students to appear multiple times in
	  the same round when there was a panel of judges.

2.04.09
	
	- There have been on the fly changes made over the month of
	  January.  January is also, in a row, Newton South, Big Lex, and
	  then Columbia.  So I don't have time to breathe much, never mind
	  document things, in January. 

	- Fixed a flaw where the public tournament listing was not showing
	  deadlines in the proper timezone of the tournament. 

	- The speaker code numbers are now to the right of the names/titles
	  on the master ballots, to assist in clearer data entry.  Additionally,
	  if you choose to have school codes revealed on schematics, they now
	  will also be revealed on master ballots.

===CHANGES RELEASED 1.6.08====

12.22.08
		
	- Added a perfect tie sensor to the breaking process.  Unbreakable
	  ties (unbreakable according to your tiebreakers, that is) will
	  be highlighted in red on the break-results screen when you break
	  into an elim round.  If the perfect tie happens at the boundary 
	  between the breakers and the non-breakers, you'll get this big
	  red warning messages.

	  I've also made it so the break screen says which tiebreakers
	  are which, and gives you the option to click through directly
	  either to the schemat.  You can also click directly to add a
	  kid into the elim round manually from the results screen if
	  you wish.

===CHANGES RELEASED 12.17.08====

12.17.08

	- Added under the Breaks screen a way to easily re-break a round if
	  you've screwed something up in breaking.  This option lets you 
	  either clear the last elim in an event of all the kids (maintaining
	  preset judge assignments and rooms) or just delete the round 
	  altogether.

	- Added a function in the comp edit screen to switch a competitor's
	  event quickly without having to do the drop & add rigamarole.

	- Added support for NFL districts registration to allow coaches to
	  register piece titles.  Piece titles will appear in the output for
	  Register->Events both printed and on screen.  The system does not
	  yet support paneling NFLs so it will not take identical piece
	  titles into account to avoid students doing the same piece hitting
	  each other in rounds.

	- Postings for rounds with more than 3 judges or 6 kids in the round
	  would carry over onto another page.  This was annoying; I fixed it
	  so now you need more than 8 kids and/or 6 judges to cause a 2 page
	  skip.
	
	- Added a feature under Panel->Judges that will allow you to set, on
	  a round-by-round basis, how many judges you want in a given round
	  of an event.  This setting is for tournaments like the Holly which
	  have a surplus of underused judges but not quite enough to do 2
	  judges panels in every room.  Using these settings, you can set it
	  up such that every student gets 4 or 5 judges, say, for 3 prelim
	  rounds.

===CHANGES RELEASED 12.10.08====

12.9.08

	- At last, a functional printable room master is available under
	  Panel->assign rooms.  
	  
	  However, due to limitations on the printing system, times are
	  counted in 15 minute time segments.  If you schedule your
	  timeslots to end in times other than on the 15s (0, 15, 30, 45)
	  the thing won't print for now.  
	
	  Note that it is no longer necessary to schedule rounds to end 5
	  minutes or so before the start of the next round in order to use
	  rooms or judges back to back; the Settings->Judge back to back
	  rounds does this instead.
	
12.7.08

	- Fixed a weird bug where bizarre extra panels were created by the
	  thousands. 

	- Fixed a bug where people using the quality of competition
	  tiebreaker after those thousands of extra panels had been created
	  would grind the system to a screaming halt.  This confused the
	  hell out of everyone involved, and caused chaos and bloodshed at
	  Princeton this weekend.  

	  Since I was at the beach at the time it was discovered, I was
	  unable to fix it until after the tournament.  Chavez and Barb G
	  pulled it through on time anyway.  Computers only take us so far
	  in tab; good humans are needed to drive things too.

	- Fixed a bug where adding a preset elimination round after the
	  prelims were paneled would result in all the information
	  pertaining to said prelims rounds would be stripped out entirely
	  from the database.  This bug is what caused the Great Kentucky
	  Massacre.

12.4.08

	- Added a Pre-panel elims menu under Panel which allows the batch
	  creation of a bunch of pre-paneled rounds, instead of having to
	  slog through each event individually to do so.

===CHANGES RELEASED 12.1.08====

12.1.08
	Fixed (at last) the Huge Housing Bug, which caused a massacre of
	housing requests when you dropped a competitor from the tournament.
	This proved a simple bug in the end; the trouble was that people kept
	reporting it to me as "housing went away when i was moving housing
	around" when it actually happens when you dropped a kid from the
	tournament overall, not just their housing request.  

	Now onto figuring out the Great Kentucky Massacre of 11/22.

	Also fixed a couple of minor housing errors.

	Added a drop shadow effect to make it less likely for you to click on
	the wrong button.

11.27.08	
	Made some visual tweaks to the housing interface.

	Made a way for a tournament director to remove a housing request
	directly from the housing master list.

===CHANGES RELEASED 11.12.08====

11.11.08
	Happy Veteran's Day from 30,000 feet above Kansas.  90th anniversary
	of the end of World War I.  Go fig. 
	
	You know, traveling to San Diego and back in the course of three
	days for a 10 hour long meeting really knocks the crap out of you,
	even if you do manage to get an exit row seat for 3 out of the 4
	legs of the trip. 

	- Made some of the code look a little nicer and a little less like
	  it had been formatted by a drunken lemur.

	- Added little logout & change league buttons to the top menubar to
	  make it easier to do those things. 

	- Made it so if you switch leagues the system will not "remember"
	  an old tournament in a different league anymore but start afresh.

	- Altered the TRIE export to allow the user to select both judge
	  pools and speech events needing exporting. 

	- Toned down the gargantuan size of the TAB menu by moving some
	  functions into the Other button at the bottom of the menu. 

	- Fixed a flaw in the single-file export system where judges who
	  could judge multiple divisions were showing up twice in the
	  export, rather than simply being listed twice.  This involved some
	  really infuriating reverse engineeing.  I am displeased. 

	- Added a registration logging system that will dump a message into
	  the Register -> Drops and Changes log every time a coach adds,
	  drops, or mucks around with housing for various registrants.  It
	  will even point fingers and tell you who did it, so you can deal
	  with those schools which seem to be run by sixteen different
	  people who expect you to mediate between them. 

	  This feature is an optional setting in the Setup -> Settings
	  screen because it WILL produce a giant pile of data very quickly.
	  You can clear all the changes logged in the Drops and Changes
	  screen with the little button at the top, but once you clear them
	  out they're lost & gone forever. 

11.09.08	
	
	- Fixed a flaw where ballots were being created in final rounds that
	  had no competitor listed in them.  This caused the ballot for that
	  judge not to come up in the data entry screens, and to tick me off
	  at the end of the day in a tournament at precisely the moment when
	  we're really ready to go home.
	
	- Fixed a couple more housing bugs that Menick managed to find.
	  Judge housing preferences were not visible to the user, fixed
	  that.

	- Added zebra striping and cleaner formatting to the individual
	  school results reports. 

	- Made the error messages and instructions around the TRPC single
	  file export more suitably sarcastic. 

===CHANGES RELEASED 10.30.08====

10.30.08
	- Reverse engineered the TRPC import method that Goy of Tournaments
	  uses, which imports debate events more cleanly into TRPC using a
	  single file.  This will put information about strikes and judge
	  restrictions into the Notes section of TRPC for each judge.  It
	  also shortens school names itself when needed, and creates
	  non-conflicting team names where kids have the same initials.

	- Also added support to enter names of contestants in events with
	  more than 2 students involved in addition to their team name.

10.29.08
	It's 4-3 Philadelphia in the bottom of the 7th.  Like any
	self-respecting Boston fan, I'm rooting for the Phillies.

	- Fixed a few inconsistencies and bugs with how hired judges were
	  presented in the school registration screen.  Hired judge requests
	  are always stored in the database in terms of how many students a
	  hired judge can cover; the whole-judge method needs a little math
	  to present the right numbers, and this wasn't happening. 

	- Fixed a highly annoying bug where housing requests weren't seen.
	  Again.  Made the output of housing printouts more attractive.

	Phillies just won!  Yay for them!

	- Altered the disaster check to also check for non-dropped and
	  non-waitlisted speech and congress kids without assignments.
	  Disaster check is also vastly faster now; it was checking through
	  24,000 table columns before with no purpose.

10.27.08	
	- This changelog is now visible under the "League" menu on the
	  registration side of the system. 

10.25.08
	- Added a screen where the school codes of an entire ballot can be
	  looked up at once. 

	- Fixed a couple of bugs in the new double-entry method of ballot
	  entry which weren't saving speaker points correctly. 

10.24.08
	- Added a "Save & Enter Next" button on the registrant's judge
	  entry, so they can speed through judge registration faster.

	- If you check off both Allow Hired Judges and the Fine Per Missing
	  Judge, the system will now bill the school without having to
	  explicitly request judges, and will create invoices that show a
	  total instead of the warning messages.

	- Fixed a bug where if an event spilled over, kids in different
	  events would end up with the same speaker code.  Now no two kids
	  will end up with the same speaker codes.  Codes will also "fill
	  in" when kids are deleted/dropped, rather than always going
	  higher; if 901 is dropped and there are 87 kids entered, the next
	  kid gets 901 not 988.

===CHANGES RELEASED ON 9.24.08====

10.24.08
	Added under the Panel menu two new features:

	1. View Schedules screen that will give you access to each
	event's individual schedule and the ability to pre-set
	elimination rounds without having to go to the schematic first.

	2. Panel Everything menu; you can now just panel all the
	events, and optionally rooms and judges too, in one batch run
	rather than having to go through everything manually.  Hit the
	button, pick your section numbers, and let the program do the
	rest.

10.22.08
	Added in support for Kentucky's sweepstakes system, which awards a
	set number of points based on prelim cumulative scores.

	Fixed a weird bug where people at housed tournaments could not print
	out their tournament entry screen.

	Changed the aesthetics of invoices a little bit, zebra-striped etc.

10.18.08	
	Fixed a bug which would not display concessions ordering.  Also fixed
	another bug where concessions orders would not copy from year to year. 

10.14.08
	- Fixed a bug where under very weird conditions involving preset
	finals and certain tiebreakers, results for the final round would
	not display or even be calculated.

	- Added all the new deadlines to the tournament information
	website.


===CHANGES RELEASED ON 09.22.08====

9.22.08	
	- Added in the event edit screen the option to set a separate 
	entry deadline for certain events.  This is useful in situations
	when people do not understand how to read the English language
	and therefore ignore admonishments both directly on the
	registration screen and repeated in the tournament invitation.

	I'll be having that drink now.

	- Added in a feature when you go into the Schedule screen for a
	round, and then view the panels, where you can copy and clone the
	panels of a given round wholesale into another round.  This is
	handy if you have a congress assignment entered manually and you
	want to duplicate it for multiple sessions with the same chambers.

9.21.08	

	- Added in automatic panel smoothing and rebalancing into the
	paneling algorithm.  This makes things run slower, but you don't
	have to hit improve & rebalance obsessively either, like I always
	did.  I'm going to be working on optimizing the paneling process
	to speed it up a little and also make the speaker order selector a
	little faster next.  Once that's done, I'm going to make a big "Do
	Everything" button so you don't have to shepherd the process
	yourself.

	- Master ballots and schemats now put asterisks next to double
	entry codes.  This is only if the double entry conflicts with the
	round; if someone is entered in an event in a different timeslot,
	no asterisk will appear.  This maintains true for elim rounds; if
	a student double breaks they will be asterisked, but not if they
	drop in their other event.


===CHANGES RELEASED ON 09.14.08====

9.14.08	
	- Added a command under Register to send emails to registering
	coaches; you can send email to everyone, or specifically coaches
	with entries in given events.

	You can also send an email to schools that are short on judges to
	yell at them too, if you see fit.

	- Added a separate screen for sweepstakes entry so it's now off
	the big giant settings page.

	On the sweepstakes page, a few new options.  First, you can give
	points for simply entering the tournament.  Second, you can put in
	a set number of points for individuals making certain placements;
	6 points for 1st, 5 points for 2nd, etc.

	Points in sweepstakes are cumulative; if you give 1 point for
	entering, 1 point for elim, 1 point for finals, and 3 points for
	winning in a tournament with quarters, the student will be awarded
	7 sweepstakes points (1 for entering, 1 for quarters, 1 for semis,
	1 for finals, and 3 for winning.)

	This should allow certain systems (my high school invitationals,
	College AFA/NFA tournaments, New Jersey States) to calculate
	sweepstakes within the system.


9.13.08	

	- Adjusted the screen appearance so the "Choose Ballot" button on
	auditing won't be easily mistaken for saving the ballot.

	- Added a handy "change judge" link to the ballot entry screen
	that takes you to the screen where you can change the judge who
	actually judged a ballot while you're in data entry mode.  This
	does not work for sessions that have been locked. (Charlie Sloat's
	suggestion).

	- Adjusted the bid system.  If your local league uses bids, you
	can track them by setting the appropriate setting on
	League->Settings to Track Bids.  If you do not check this, the bid
	options in your tournament settings will not appear. 

	The previous bid system was hard-coded to only work with the
	Massachusetts league.  The new bid system will now work for any
	league that wants to use it, like Jersey.  The one caveat though
	is that tournaments MUST have the same abbreviation (VX for
	Varsity Extemp, PR for Prose) from tournament to tournament, or
	else the bids will be counted as separate events. (For Joe A).


9.12.08	

	- Made an option that recognized top novices either based on the
	top placing novice overall (Massachusetts) or the top novice who
	did not advance to elim rounds (New Jersey).  To enable the Jersey
	system, I also fixed a long standing issue where non-advancing
	contestants were displayed on the results sheets in semi-random
	orders; they are now sorted according to their placement within
	the prelim rounds.  (for Dave Y).

	- Eliminated some housing bugs Jim Menick, ah, reported.

	Housing will now auto-waitlist housing requests from students who
	are also (only) on the tournament waitlist for their usual entry.
	When you un-waitlist their usual entry, they will also be admitted
	off the housing waitlist as long as space exists; if there is no
	space they will stay on the housing waitlist.

	Flags a warning when you incorrectly try to use both judge hiring
	methods; the system only supports one or the other.  (You can
	account for hired judges either per whole judge, or by charging
	per student not covered by judging, which is a fractional judge).

	Fixed a bug where if you're using the whole-hired-judge method the
	totals weren't showing the right way.

9.8.08	
	The printouts for event listings were really doing something ugly.
	I have fixed it.

	Congress judges STILL weren't totaling right.  I fixed that too.
	Why do we do Congress, anyway?  (for Yale).

===CHANGES RELEASED ON 09.07.08====

9.7.08	
	Housing changes are now complete. Instead of registering for
	housing on the cumbersome screen within the student entry, a
	separate listing for housing now exists which is much easier to
	use, I hope.

	Registrant schools can now cancel housing requests, or transfer
	them to other students, using this screen. 

9.1.08	
	Happy Labor Day!

	Made some cosmetic changes; the font should be easier to read, I
	hope, and the menubar is shiny and blue now.

	Housing status is now changeable on the competitor information
	screen as well as through the Register->Housing listing.

	The master housing lists will now remove any students who because
	of drops are no longer registered in the tournament at all.
	Deleting a student will also remove their housing request, though
	dropping a student will not. 

	Master housing lists are now printable and exportable into Excel.

	Fixed a bug where the date a housing request was made on would
	change whenever any change to that housing request was made, not
	the original date of the request.

8.31.08
	Implemented online judge strikes.  In each judging category you
	can set the number of allowed strikes per school, dates when
	strikes can be entered, and dates when they are due.  The
	registrant programs can then enter their strikes online, and the
	strikes will be recorded just like any other school constraint
	against a judge (though it will be marked also as a school entered
	strike; tournament-entered school strikes against a judge will NOT
	appear on this screen.)

	The judge strike screen will warn schools that have not yet
	covered their own judging that they must do so, and will only give
	the option to enter strikes to schools that have filled their
	obligation, through a combination of hires and judges.


===CHANGES RELEASED on 8.29.08====

8.28.08	
	I'm so glad I've touched no code over the summer.  I've spent a
	lot of time at the lake, some time reading, slept in a lot.  If
	any of you have a problem with that, go write your own damn
	program and leave me alone.
	
	- An option under Setup->Settings to require a school to enter the
	name and contact info of a responsible adult before they can go
	any further with your tournament registration.
	
	- Changes in the way that judge accounting works:

	You can select whether to charge for judges by number of judges
	hired OR by how many students the hired judging is supposed to
	cover.  The screens on the registrant's end of things are a bit
	more clear and shift around depending on which option you pick.

	Also, you can designate the size of your pool of hired judging in
	the preferences for a judge group (in Setup->events), and the
	program will automatically accept judging hire requests that fit
	within that pool and reject anything beyond, on a first come first
	serve basis.

	- You can also set up a flat judging obligation for event pools
	where people must bring a certain number of judges no matter how
	many kids they bring; this is sometimes useful in Congress.

	- Invoices for schools that don't have their judging house in order
	will refuse to display a total, and will instead display a warning
	that the judging situation is Messed Up and Needs Fixing.  This is
	to prevent certain scurrulous activities from Yales past (The
	invoice said X so I paid X!). 

	- Invoices and student rosters are now printable in color and easier
	to read alternating account-ledger style bands rather than
	difficult to read lines.  The bands should show up on B&W printers
	as well. 

	- And finally, under Panel->Printouts, you can print out
	ready-made cards for both Debate contestants and Debate judges,
	should you have a small enough debate division that you just want
	to hand tab it without having to import everything into TRPC to
	print cards from there. 

5.25.08	
	Ability to print a log of all tournament fines.

5.22.08 
	More reports galore for the NCFL, including hand tab cards. 

	Changed the Change Log to track judge moves, and whether they were
	the result of a fine or not. 
	
	Adjusted the way the judges' preference speaker order is applied to
	allow it to function a second time after another tiebreaker has
	been attempted; so you can run judges preference, and if there's a
	three way tie run reciprocals to get rid/advance another
	competitor, and if there's still a tie, run judges' preference
	again.  This was not possible before. 

5.15.08	
	Tons of reports for the NCFL.  Most will not appear to non-NCFL
	users. 
	
	Breaking events has changed.  It will now attempt to guess the
	settings for the next elimination round based on a variety of
	factors, and cleans up the interface to advance to a new
	elimination round. 
	
	Reformatted a lot of schematics and reports to be zebra-striped
	instead of line-separated for greater readability. These are in
	color on the screen, but printing via black and white is still
	legible.

5.5.08
	Judge cards can be printed individually and by diocese.  By
	tournament as yet creates a memory error; will find a way to expand
	the available memory for LaTeX.

	Integrity checking for NCFL speaker order analyzer.

4.25.08	
	Automatic moves via the panel improver and the panel rebalancer now
	will tell you which students they moved where, so you can use the
	rebalancer to change things mid tournament.
	
	Function on the tournament info screen to delete all waitlisted
	competitors in one stroke. 

	Just substitution sheets are now printable in the Panel->Printouts
	screen by timeslot, which is, after all, far more useful.

4.23.08
	Many dozens of reports for NCFLs added.

	Added a Rooms Required report and general statistics report in the
	Register->Information screen.

	Adjusted the paneling mechanism for NCFLs to panel speech events
	penalizing diocese hits just like region hits.

	Cleaned up the event listing interface; removed the ability to
	recode the speaker codes just by hitting a button there.  Instead
	there is now the ability to print the entry or download the
	contestants in a CSV file directly on the entries screen.

4.21.08
	Making the pull down menus listing substitute judges in the Panel
	View, and various others, display column-based data better; it's
	much more readable now.

	Improve Panels will no longer touch panels with judges already
	assigned to them to prevent kids from getting subbed into rounds
	their own judges are judging.

	I took "Add Schools" out of the menu and put it into Tournament
	Information; it was too cluttery where it was.


4.11.08	
	Made a sheet where you can print out a listing of which rooms
	are in the pool for which events.
	
	Made a sheet where you can print out your judge list by group
	or overall in Register->Judges.

4.5.08
	Fixed a bug that would not drop the worst speech ballot with the
	lowest speaker points, but instead would drop a speech ballot with
	the worst rank at random, regardless of points.

	Fixed a bug that that bug introduced in the sweepstakes system.

	Laughed at Charlie's emails about sixteen times from the comfort
	and safety of the Massachusetts state tournament.

4.3.08	
	On the bus to Albany, I made a much nicer room master that draws
	blocks out to the length of the round.  Currently it will only
	work well if your rounds all begin and end on the 15 minute marks
	exactly; I'm going to rachet this down to 5 when I can figure
	out how. 

	Panel->assign rooms->print room master to see it. 

3.29.08	
	Fixed a small bug wherein drop fines were being only applied
	before the deadline, not after.

===Released changes on 3/27/08===

3.27.08	
	Added a screen under Register->Information where you can list
	your schools  (with state, code and, if applicable, region).
	This same screen also allows you to scramble your school codes
	in various and sundry anonymizing ways, as well as restoring
	them back to your league defaults.

3.26.08
	Made a "tournament statistics" screen accessible from
	Register->Information where you can get data on how many warm
	bodies and entries your tournament has overall.

	Also made a few reports specific to the NCFL (Tab room staff)

3.20.08 	
	Added a separate deadline for judge adds, drops & changes.  Also
	put in a feature that tells registering schools what the various
	deadlines are on the registration screen.


3.11.08	
	Changed the system so New York State regional directors can
	see qual information better for their region's schools.  Displays
	region information in the registration screen for each school.
	Also stores regional membership information in the database in a
	less clunky manner.  Fixed some minor formatting fun with the
	school registration page in IE6.  I hate IE.

===Released changes on 3/10/08===


3.2.08	
	Added a room pool & quality tracking feature.  If you go to
	Setup->Rooms, you can assign rooms into pools by event.  Marking a
	room as part of a pool will mean that the automatic room assigner
	will prefer that room for that event, and de-prefer it for other
	events.  You can also mark a room to ONLY be used for events it's
	pooled to.  And finally, you can mark a room as being poor quality,
	which will mean that it will be used only if there are no other
	options, regardless of pool status. 
	
3.1.08	
	Added time tracking to drops.  The Register->Drops screen will
	now sort every drop by the timestamp when it was made, most
	recent drops at the top of the screen.  This will probably be
	most useful to debate types who import stuff into TRPC and want
	lists of changes that happen after the import.

	Added a separate "Add entry deadline" to the Setup->Access screen,
	which allows tournament directors to set a different deadline
	after which registered schools may drop or name change entries and
	judges on their own, and add judges, but they cannot add further
	entries.

	Also added a separate "Fine-free drop deadline."  Entries dropped
	after this date will be dropped, not wholly deleted, so entry fees
	will still apply when they drop, and any drop fees will be added
	to their invoice.  Before it, when users drop their own kids, they
	will not be charged either registration or entry fees.

===Released changes on 2/16/08===


2.10.08	
	Added support for the NYSFL to ask for two qualifying tournaments
	and also the placement & field size within the qualifying tourneys.

2.2.08	
	Fixed a bug where congress would not panel if the minimum chamber
	size in the settings was smaller than the number of students in
	the event; now it gives an option for 1 chamber. 


===Released changes on 1/24/08===

1.24.08	
	Corrected a minor bug where invoices would sometimes not print 
	if the message on the invoice (which is settable in
	Setup->settings) is blank.

1.23.08
	System will now print an NCFL style master ballot with whichever
	rules you put into the event description right on the master ballot.
	To select this, go to setup->event for the event, and pick "NCFL".
	Then put your event rules as you want them to appear on the ballot
	master into the Event Description box.

	To select whether your masters print names or ask for titles is
	now an option in the Settings page, not a print-time option.

1.22.08	
	Public postings!  You can now publish rounds on the tabroom.com 
	website round by round by going to the event's schematic and clicking
	on "publish" for each round you want made public.  They will appear
	on your tournament info page linked off the right sidebar on Tabroom.com.

	Speech postings will be by code, and congress postings by full name 
	and school.

1.7.08	
	When assigning rooms, the system will not change room assignments
	for pre-set elimination rounds when you select the "All" box.

1.4.08	
	Last non-tournament Saturday until the week after Harvard.  Kill me
	now, please.
	
	Added an option to the settings screen on whether or not you want
	judges to be assigned to back to back rounds (Yes if you want a
	judge who's judging a round ending at 10:00 to be blocked from
	rounds that begin at 10:00).  Previously folks had been having
	rounds end 5 minutes past the start of the previous round to
	simulate this; this setting means you can make a "real" schedule
	and still not allow back to back rounds. 

	It also is necessary for the printable rooms master I'm making;
	overlapping rounds will screw that up big time.

12.30.07	
	Tweaked said interface to allow tournament directors to add and
	remove kids from the housing waitlist. 

12.28.07	
	Added the management interface for housing so tournament directors
	can actually see the requests made at their tournament.

12.15.07	
	Tweaked housing to remove a bug where housing requests remained
	after kids were deleted. 


11.29.07
	Housing requests now work for requestors; people can request 
	housing by night for judges and/or students individually.  
	Housing requests over a certain number will get added to waitlist,
	as will housing requests from waitlisted entries.

11.28.07	
	More work on the registration interface.  Now it works with 2 and
	multiple student events.  Housing cap worked for a while and now 
	does not. 

11.27.07	
	The interface where coaches register kids is totally changed.  They
	can register an entire event at a time.  This interface also allows
	them to request housing by specific night, and an automatic cap on
	the number of housing slots will be enforced, with remainders going
	onto a waitlist for housing.  The Setup screen also now has a housing
	command to enter how many slots of housing are available on a given
	night, and the Housing screen in Register will be altered to show
	more info (timestamp request was created, gender, housing by night, etc).

11.20.07
	Made some cosmetic changes to various small parts of the league admin
	interface and student roster (alternating grey bars for readability,
	things like that).


=== Released changes on 11/4/07 ===

11.4.07	
	Added a feature where a tournament can forbid schools from entering
	if their league dues are not paid (request by Alicia & Brother John
	from the NYSFL).

	Accounts with access to a tournament are now only publicly listed
	as contacts if they are the tournament director, or explicitly
	given access as "contacts" in the Setup->Access screen.

	Also added the "Publish Online" item in the Panel menubar.  From
	this screen, individual rounds' schematics can be posted online,
	if you want to release panels or break rounds ahead of time on
	the web.

	Hurrah for Daylight Savings Time.

11.3.07	Man, it's really raining hard out there.

	Added support to ask coaches to enter judge paradigms along with
	registration.  This is an optional setting by event grouping.

	Paradigms may be published on the tournament information screen
	ahead of time (from Setup->Settings), or printouts may be made from
	Registration-> Information.

	Changed judge printouts to include school code in judge codes
	instead of "J".  Removed therefore a point of confusion.

11.2.07	TRPC, TRIE, and CSV export was including dropped and waitlisted 
	students; I removed them after Menick passive-aggressively bitched 
	on his blog instead of, y'know, emailing me to ask.  Just sayin'.

10.31.07	Fixed bug where by reassigning rooms for prelims and removing
	existing assignments, TDs removed assignments from every tournament
	in the system, not just their own.  Oops.

10.27.07	Option in the Event Setup screen to merge events together
	instead of deleting them.  That way if you collapse JV and Varsity
	LD together or something, you don't have to re-enter any kids

10.26.07	Removing a tournament site moves rounds to an existing site.
	Additing a tournament site to an empty tournament moves rounds 
	to that site.
