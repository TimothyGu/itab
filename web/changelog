	- If you are using online ballot entry but some judges prefer paper
	  ballots, you can now print all ballots from a debate pairing for
	  "Unlinked Accounts".  Only ballots for judges who are not linked to a
	  Tabroom account will thereby be printed.

	- Results can now be displayed and made public on a file by file basis
	  instead of event-by-event so you can publish parts of a result file
	  without publishing the whole thing.

	- Printing out judge cards for manual debate pairing would lead to
	  duplicate entries; no longer!

	- Fixed a bug whereby if you downloaded to TRPC, and then registration
	  changes happened, then you imported prefs after that, pref sheets could
	  end up corresponding to the wrong debaters.  

	- Joy of Tournaments importer.  Tabroom can import the Joy export files so
	  you can register debate events onto Joy and then run/tab your tournament
	  on Tabroom if you prefer.  Right now it imports data but not MJP
	  preferences (yet).


==CHANGES RELEASED 9.12.2013==

	- Debate Support. ("Yaaaaay!"). Tabroom can panel and tabulation a debate
	  format in its ordinary form, as it were.  Unlike IEs, which are paired en
	  masse at the start of a tournament, debate rounds should largely be
	  created and interacted with on the pairing directly; go to round one and
	  hit "Auto-pair Round" on the right to create round 1, and then do the
	  same for round 2, and then power matched rounds after the results for
	  previous rounds are all entered.
	
	  Breaks also can be conducted directly on the elimination round pairings.
	  Click on "Edit Settings" under Change and Destroy to see various round
	  options for pairing and judge placement.

	  Tabroom can (rudimentally) place judges in an MJP division, though it has
	  not been fully tested yet, and it has not been done for elimination
	  rounds yet, though the manual judge placement method can work for elim
	  rounds with preferences.

	  High-High Powermatching and Lag pairing are coming soon.  
	  
	  If something were to go wrong with pairing debate using new software, you
	  may download your tournament into the CAT to pair further and then upload
	  into Tabroom.com; or you can download into the CAT and then export that
	  XML for importation into TRPC.  The ability to directly import data into
	  TRPC is coming soon.

	- Round Robin support.  Tabroom can panel a traditional debate round robin
	  with multiple pods and one less round than the number of entries in each
	  pods. Supports side equalization and byes.  Note that when pairing a
	  round robin, pairing a single round from the schematic screen will pair
	  the ENTIRE round robin's prelims in one fell swoop.

	- Full WUDC style British Parliamentary support.  Testing and documentation
	  coming soon, but it now supports pairing prelims, powered prelims by
	  bracket, judge priority assignment using tab ratings, powerpoint
	  generation, speaker award and teams in order reporting, online balloting,
	  advancing to elimination rounds, online balloting and managmenet of elim
	  rounds, and online posting & text/email blasting.

	- Slideshows.  If you go to Paneling -> Reports, and click on a timeslot
	  and select an event next to Slideshow, Tabroom will now display an
	  auto-advancing (every 15 seconds) slideshow of a timeslot's rounds which
	  can be projected if you wish.

	  Slides will be one per round for elim rounds and 5 per round for prelims.

	- You can now create fake divisions within tournaments for testing.  A
	  tournament must be marked as "Test Tournament: Hidden" under the Setup ->
	  Tournament -> Settings menu for this to work.  First go to Setup ->
	  Events to specify division sizes and school distributions, and then go to
	  Setup -> Judges to create fake pools of judges to go with.  Then you can
	  panel as usual.  Go to the schematic and look for the red box on the
	  lower right to fake enter random ranks for an entire event.

	- Public bug listing.  I've created a listing of bugs using a software
	  system called bugzilla.  It's visible at http://bugs.tabroom.com.  Feel
	  free to browse what we're working on.  You can log into this site with
	  your Tabroom username and password, and add yourself to the CC list for a
	  bug if you'd like to be informed of updates or when a bug is fixed
	  directly.

	- Fixed a bug where the start and ending times of new tournaments were
	  being automatically set to midnight UTC no matter what you set them to be
	  in the initial request.

==CHANGES RELEASED 6.3.2013==

	- Inconsistencies with the way Master ballots would print given certain
	  combinations of settings have been ironed out.

	- Simplified a lot of the tournament wide settings into one set of screens
	  and one menu option, instead of a bunch (main, dates, access, messages,
	  housing).

	- Ballot entry screen will auto-advance if you're using partial points; so
	  if you're doing half points, a 255 or a 25. will auto-translate to a
	  25.5; while if you're doing tenth points a 52 will become a 25.2 and a 40
	  will become a 24.0.   Quarter points will transate a 42 to a 24.25 and a
	  55 to a 25.5.  This is mostly useful for debate.

	- Moved all tabulation and registration options that used to be tournament
	  wide, such as size of panels, judge restrictions, qualification
	  requirements, etc into event specific places:

	  	- Paneling options, elim methods, top novice, etc -> event settings
		- Back to back judges, panels, etc -> judge group settings
		- Truncation, noshows, time violations -> Tiebreaker settings.

	  Hopefully this change will better enable larger tournaments with
	  disparate divisions to create settings for their tournaments.   This
	  change is also necessary for debate paneling & tabulation support which
	  will be released by the end of the summer.
	  

==CHANGES RELEASED 5.28.2013==

	- Added a tournament wide "Dashboard" to the Tabbing -> Status main screen
	  so you can see the status of the whole tournament at any given time, with
	  each division/event in a box.  This page will auto refresh every minute.

	- Postings on the web can now be set to exclude the judging panels.

	- Disaster check would not actually check for panels short on judges; fixed

	- Registration log was strange around searching and time zones; fixed.

	- Fixed a bug where entries who were not tabbed through Tabroom would not
	  appear in the sweepstakes totals

==CHANGES RELEASED 5.21.2013==


	- Vast speed improvements to the results calculating engine and the
	  sweepstakes calculating engine.  Results display used to be a matter of
	  about 5-30 seconds depending on the size of your tournament; now it
	  should be anywhere from half a second to maybe 2-3.

	- Debate results can now be generated directly on the Web Publish screen,
	  so long as Tabroom is set up to understand the tiebreakers.  Speaker
	  awards are not enabled yet until I apply the new faster results engine to
	  them.

	- School reports now include debate results that have been uploaded into
	  Tabroom.  They also have been reformatted a little for legibility.

	- Added a method where you can download a template CSV file in excel to
	  enter sweepstakes points manually using a spreadsheet in addition to or
	  instead of the online interface.

	- Added a rankinround tiebreaker; this will calculate the rank within a
	  previous round to add to the current total.  So if you want to add the
	  ranks of a student in final together with their placement in quarters,
	  say, as a single rank; this tiebreaker will do that.

	- Section labels can now be set optionally to letters instead of numbers

	- Fixed a bug where if you used the search box in the tournament admin side
	  and there was a matching school, it would dump you to that school even if
	  there were other matching schools or entries or judges, so you couldn't
	  pick the one you wanted.

	- More NCFL stuff.

	- The Shenanigans report is restored under Register -> reports.  For now it
	  just checks for judges entered twice under different schools.  More
	  shenanigans will be added as people pull them.

==CHANGES RELEASED 5.08.2013==
	
	- Many other changes because it's been a hugely busy month and I've been
	  running tournaments like the TOC and the NDCA and so on and making lots
	  of little changes and improvements on the fly but not always being good
	  about documenting them.  I promise I'll do better.

	- Beginnings of the WUDC upload system so the world debate rankings can be
	  uploaded into the Tabroom database.

	- Many many NCFL reports and stuff.  Printable on parchment with the Pope's
	  blessing.

	- Elim brackets now appear if the tournament was uploaded from TRPC instead
	  of the CAT.  To post an elim bracket, go to Results -> Web Publish.

	- Elim breaks & Results generation for Congress.  this is not yet complete
	  and fully tested.

	- Pairing Congress support for the TOC.  I've added in a much better
	  Congress paneler that will account for school separation, state
	  separation if you have multiple states, and will permit you to seed the
	  congress prelim panels by enabling "Pair prelims based on seeding" in the
	  setup->event screen and then entering the students' preliminary seeding
	  under Entries->Events on the right. 

	  The paneler will separate same schools first, then same states, then
	  endeavor as much as possible to make each prelim chamber's seed total add
	  up to the same number without breaking the first two constraints.

	- Fixed the display of ballots in the results screens to better reflect bye
	  debates and to format better so results of debate rounds show better.

	- Fixed a bug where events would not show up on the results display if only
	  files had been uploaded instead of native internal results
	
	- Added in the ability to set arbitrary numbers of high/low drops, not just
	  one or two, for tiebreakers.  So if you really want to have quintuple
	  high-low points as a tiebreaker, go nuts.

	- Fixed the ordinal prefs screen to show win/losses and not ballot count in
	  divisions with multiple judge prelim rounds

	- Added the coach emails to the XML download for a school (CEDA/Larson)

	- Fixed a bug where paneled prelims meant the prelim results in order
	  display would show ballot count as win/loss, not actual win/loss (NDT)

	- Added features to view and report on at-large entries (TOC/Reed).

==CHANGES RELEASED 3.20.2013==

	- Added a screen under Tabulation to confirm when panels are started (for
	  runners, hall monitors, etc).
	
	- Changed invoices so that they can be combined concessions & entry fees in
	  one invoice or separated at the tournamnet director's discretion; the
	  setting is under Setup -> Money under Concessions on the right
	  (NDT/Bruschke)

	- A registering coach can also download their registrating entirely to a
	  spreadsheet (Donnelly)

	- Prefs can be exported to a CSV (spreadsheet) document now at any time.

	- NCFL registration complete.

==CHANGES RELEASED 3.8.2013==

	- More NCFL stuff. 

	- Added piece titles to the entries CSV export.

	- Fixed an inconsistency with judging burdens and events without
	  obligations.

	- Upgraded the main javascript library; this should make the drag and drop
	  features in various places (room assignments; pref sheets) work better
	  under Internet Explorer, especially more recent versions.

	- The TRPC download will yield shorter school names to better work with the
	  TRPC character limits

	- Massively overhauled the entry code setting system to be more consistent
	  and less just weird.  Added the option to assign entry codes by full
	  school name & initials instead of truncated 6 character names.  Also
	  redid parts of the TRPC upload to better deal with the TRPC character
	  limits.

	- Kentucky states uses a different semifinal snake formula; it is now an
	  option under Settings -> Rules -> Tabulation.

==CHANGES RELEASED 2.26.13==

	- You can now send email and texts to judges who are linked to tabroom
	  without a pairing if you go to Entries -> Emails and pick the judge group
	  on the right hand side.

	- Entry reports now include qualification information.

	- Added the ability to create a sweepstakes set that applies only to
	  entries whose students are all novices (Mass: Mardi Gras).

	- Added the ability to enter at-larges and qualifiers in greater numbers to
	  accomodate the TOC and other tournaments

	- Added a "display round entries" at the very bottom right of the admin's
	  schematic display, largely out of lazyness because this makes it much
	  easier to submit TOC bids.

	- Fixed an error-producing bug in the search box.

	- Adapted the XML uploader to be more forgiving of tournaments where the
	  directors can't read the friggin instructions and set up their timeslot
	  schedules properly.

	- The "allow judges from the same school on the same panel" checkbox in
	  fact would do the opposite.  I've also moved it to be a judge group
	  setting from being a tournament wide setting.

	- Neutral judging, which wasn't working before and was only settable on a
	  tournament wide basis, is now working again and settable on a per-group
	  basis.  (Neutrals are judges a school brings who can judge the school's
	  own students, allowed in some areas).

	- Events can be set to block first year outs from judging  (Maine)

==CHANGES RELEASED 2.20.13==

	- Working a lot on NCFL registration screens.

	- Support for tiered preference entry by round count instead of whole judge
	  count.

	- Support for free strikes entry by registrants, and first year out,
	  together with support for allowing first year out judges to automatically
	  be counted as free strikes, and free strikes in turn to automatically not
	  count towards a school's judging obligation.  (TOC).

	- Rolled out a function where a pairing can be paired manually, either from
	  the panel screen or the schematic directly.  Mostly useful now for IE or
	  for Congress.  Debate coming soon.

	- Killed a bug that lead randomly to slow performance and hangs if someone
	  attempted to access the site with a login session which had expired.

	- Some formatting improvements and changes.

	- Cloning a tournament will now clone sweepstakes rules.

	- Fixed a master ballot formatting issue (Kentucky)

==CHANGES RELEASED 2.7.13==

	- Concessions invoices were not appearing on the full invoice; now they do.

	- Before if you dropped or namechanged an entry with housing, the housing
	  request would land in limbo, and could not be transferred to a new entry.
	  Now, if someone with housing is namechanged, the system will ask the user
	  what they want to do with the housing request; to transfer it or delete
	  it.

	- Debate results can now be displayed under Results -> Event Display, as
	  long as tiebreakers have been set in debate.  Not all tiebreakers have
	  been perfectly tested; but win/loss, points, hi/lo points, opp wins and
	  jvar have.  jvar is calculated differently from TRPC; do not expect them
	  to match.

	- Coaches can now access student records, along with any RFDs and comments
	  entered online, via the student roster; click on Record to the left of any
	  student name.

	- Coaches for the NDT/CEDA circuit can enter debater honors to the NDT bid
	  sheets via the roster/record method as well, as can individual students
	  when they first log in if they are linked to their student record.

	- Fixed a bug that would show incorrect ballot entry status when there were
	  dropped competitors assigned to a round.

	- Added support for APDA registration seeding (Free, Half, Full, None).  It
	  must be enabled in the Event (Settings -> events -> on the left) and will
	  be visible and changeable under the entry's registrant screen.

	- Fixed some formatting.

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.23.13==

	- Fixed a thing where the CSV export would bleed for school names that had
	  a comma in them; and would not list all the students.  Both fixed.

	- Wording changes when dropping a judge to terrify Mainers less :)

	- Ordinal preferences can now be calculated based on previous pref sheets
	  by clicking on "Fill in based on past pref sheets".

	- Congress can be re-paired from the automatic pairing screen even when
	  there are existing panels using the new Wipe option; otherwise it will
	  copy existing panels from other rounds.

	- Change log is now searchable by date and by default will show you today's
	  changes only

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.13.13==

	- Paradigm-book support; an attendee can view all of a given tournament's
	  paradigms or download them into a PDF file for tourneys where there is no
	  internet access available.

	- Sweepstakes are rejiggered so you can run the report either for each
	  individual sub-category or you can see the whole combined points. So
	  places like NY state which count 3 entries from 3 separate groupings,
	  should create a sweep set for Address, Interp & Reading, put the events
	  into them, and set it to limit to 2 entries; the overall report will then
	  show the top 6 entries, 2 each from each sweep set.
	
	- School reports, the printing of which (especially printing all the
	  schools) used to take until the heat death of the universe, now are
	  considerably faster (usually take 1-2 minutes for an ordinary tournament)

	- Pairings and schematics are fixed so that tournaments in IE using names
	  instead of codes should be able to display & print schematics correctly

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.9.13==

	- You can now switch the sides of debaters from the panel view screen if
	  things should get messed up.

	- There's a bracket!  CAT enabled tournaments, when they post elim round
	  results, will also be posting an elimination round bracket which will
	  auto-populate under the Results tab, click on the division, and click
	  Bracket.

	- Fixed the XML exporter to never export a NULL value and instead replace
	  them with 0s because Windows throws a hissy fit when there are null
	  values for some reason.

	- Fixed a bug where if a free number of judges was set it was being added
	  before, not after, mandatory minimums/maximums

	- Fixed an issue where the email/text blaster did not show a debater's
	  opponent in elim rounds.

	- Repaneling an event/series of events, or dumping rounds and judges, will
	  now log a message to the Change Log visible under Entries -> Change Log
	  -> Show Tabulation Log.  That way when that sort of dopey person who you
	  know screws things up regularly but you have to keep in tab anyway
	  because otherwise s/he'll never shut up about it disavows any knowledge
	  when suddenly a final round is deleted, you can conduct a definitive
	  witch hunt instead of only strongly suspecting they're the idiot in
	  question.

	  WARNING: The idiot in question will sometimes be you.  Life is miserable
	  like that.  So I recommend you check first, THEN lodge wild accusations.

	- IE judges normally are more likely to be assigned categories that their
	  own students compete in.  However, if this means judges are judging the
	  same categories day in and day out, this feature can now be disabled by
	  going to Tournament Rules -> Paneling and checking "Random IE Judge
	  Assignments" down on the bottom.  (Rouse)

	- Fixed a formatting awfulness in the housing spreadsheet.  Again.

	- Debate event schematics can now be printed off the website by going to
	  the round and selecting Print Schematic on the right.  Works for both
	  single and double flighted events.

	- Fixed a bug that was improperly counting entries in sweepstakes
	  calculation each time they got a ballot in an elim round, not for their
	  placement in the round as a whole. (Sloat)

	- Fixed a bug where the stats on a round showing when it was email blasted
	  would show instead the current time.

	- The name of a judge hired thruogh the judge exchange now appears on the
	  schools' list of hired judges.

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.7.13==

	- Fixed a problem on the public site where a team's record would not show
	  upcoming rounds.

	- Fixed a problem on the public site where a team's running record would
	  show them debating themselves.

	- Pref Report under Entries -> Reports is now by entry; it also shows you
	  each entries ratings & number of conflicts, and clicking on the entry
	  brings you to their pref sheet.

	- Fixed a little odd one where hybrid team names were displaying twice.

	- XML importer will pull the elim seeds from the CAT XML file in
	  preparation for us being able to display a full bracket.

	- Sanitized the room pool printout

	- Fixed a bug where entering judges on the tournament admin side would not
	  save judge coach ratings.

	- Added TouchPunch support which should make the menus and drag and drop
	  functions work better on touch devices such as iPads and smartphones.  (I
	  haven't been able to extensively test this as I do not have an iPad or
	  iPhone.  It works pretty well in Android).

	- Added the ability to text or email blast by section; if you click on the
	  room or judges from a single section of speech or debate, and click over
	  on the right on "text/email blast this section", you can send a message
	  that will be accompanied by the pairing for that round to a single
	  section's debaters and judges, if you have a room move or judge change or
	  something.

	- Award ceremony printout will bear a warning when there are ballots still
	  pending entry in that event.

	- Fixed a bug where hired judges were not being given judging assignments
	  by the mass paneler.

	- Fixed a bug with online ballot entry that marked all the tags for results
	  as blank and thus, y'know, didn't work.

	- Fixed a timezone bug with standing school fees.

	- Fixed an issue with the IE snake in elims, and added another option to
	  swap/protect for schools among students with the same 1st tiebreaker
	  score in addition to the current option where students who are less than
	  2 seeds apart are swapped.

	- Fixed the school code generator to better handle "University of" style
	  school names so their short-name codes didn't always end up being
	  "UniOf".

==CHANGES RELEASED 1.2.13==

	- Added a feature where if a strike/conflict gets duplicated many many
	  times, deleting just one of them will delete all identical ones.

	- Added the ability to add coach notes or special jobs, together with ADA
	  restrictions, to tournament-entered judges as they're entered.

	- Judges entered on the tournament director's side of things will retain
	  their links to their accounts; this was not working before.

	- Fixed a bug where a entry whose account is also a judge (say a college
	  debater who is also a high school judge) would cause many repeating
	  conflicts to be entered against any judge in a tournament who does not
	  have a linked account.

	- Happy 2013


==CHANGES RELEASED 12.20.12==

	- Fixed a few bugs where the numbers of judge hire requests were not being
	  reported; instead it was reporting the number of schools requesting
	  judges.

	- There is now a "results" tab when you log into your team's tabroom
	  account.  Under it you can find past tournament rosters, full results for
	  IE students, past invoices for reference, judges, etc. 

	  Debate results & ballot access are next up in the hopper here.

	- Fixed a bug where generating results meant reporting them publicly
	  whether or not you wanted to

	- Fixed a bug where the generation of results would not obey the "All"
	  setting.

	- Spiffed up the reports for results to display better

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.15.12==

	- Added a school total entry count to the sweepstakes report

	- Fixed a bug that sometimes skipped top novices from consideration.

	- Top Novice options for showing the top novice who did not clear to elims
	  now works

	- The rounds are now reverse sorted in the event results display and will
	  automatically show you the results from the latest completed round

	- Added ballots the event result display in the results menu

	- Made it so public pairings will automatically go to the latest posted
	  round rather than making you click again to go there.

	- Restored room counts to the Entries -> Reports -> Total Counts report.

	- Fixed a bug where if a round was not assigned to a site it would give you
	  this totally random list of rooms that came from God knows where.

	- Restored support for pairing Student Congress.  Congress rounds are
	  paired for prelim support only.  It will pair rooms and repeat the same
	  pairings for each prelim session.  Congress is not yet supported for
	  tabbing or breaking to finals.

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.13.12==

	- Fixed a bug where not all double entries were showing up on the double
	  entry report.

	- IE events can now publish round by round results just like the debaters
  	  can.  Results are listed by name AND code.

	- Fixed a bug where you couldn't click on a debater on their Results list
	  and see their total record.

	- Round by round results and individual prelim records for debaters using
	  the live updates feature are now also under the Results tab, not the
	  Postings tab, which in turn has been renamed to the Pairings tab.  this
	  will hopefully reduce clutter

	- The Results tab on the main website will now show past tournaments which
	  have published results or posted files.

	- Preliminary infrastructure in place to publish results on the public
	  website.  You can now publish IE results on the site and a "results" tab
	  will appear.  You can upload PDF files to post results for any event or
	  for the tournament as a whole.  You can generate results and make them
	  public on an event-by-event basis.  this is all under the Results -> 
	  Web Publish tab.  
	  
	  Even for posted PDF/file results, The event that a given file falls under
	  has to be marked "Public" or else the result will not be posted.

	  Coming next will be support for publicly posting sweepstakes scores,
	  debate results, congress results, and calculating things like bids/quals.

	- Tournament public website informational pages, such as the list of events
	  and user-created pages, are now visible under the "Main" tab instead of
	  bleeding over off the page as before.

	- Added state counts to the Stats report under Reports -> totals

	- Fixed a bug where the CSV download didn't show judges needing housing

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.08.12==

	- Free strikes support.  You can designate judges under Entries -> Judges
	  at "Free Strikes" over on the right as Free Strikes.  If they are so
	  designated they will not count against quotas for Tiered Prefs or School
	  or Entry Strikes; good for judges who are tabbing or are late adds to the
	  pref sheet or something like that.

	- Awards ceremony printout will now work for events that do not break to a
	  final round (MFL), and will skip events not directly tabbed in tabroom
	  (congress or debate).

	- Students can now enter their own pref sheets, provided that they have a
	  Tabroom account linked to their student record, and the school is set to
	  allow it.  Schools can allow it under the Settings tab when they first
	  log in, and checking the box next to "Entries may enter their own prefs"

	- Students can now enter standing conflicts against judges

	- School conflicts now carry over from students

	- Fixed a formatting bug on the events listing page

==CHANGES RELEASED 12.03.12==

	- Waitlisted entries did not appear on the roster if the settings are set to
	  waitlist-all

	- Fixed a mis-aligned header on the CSV download entry

	- Function under Data Manipulation where you can recode a debate event to
	  have schoolname/initial codes

	- Fixed a bug where all reports for a given tournament would not print
	  (Albert/MFL)

	- Waitlist and entry rosters will show how many confirmed entries each
	  school has now to help with the waitlist's management.

	- Fixed a bug that produced HORRENDOUS output for the codebreaker printout
	  if you were not using short numeric codes.

	- Fixed a bug that would not let you email all schools with entries still
	  marked TBA.

	- Fixed a bug that would not let you do school strikes without coach ratings.

	- Fixed a bug affecting certain types of master ballot printouts

	- Account holders can enter permanent conflicts against schools.  This
	  works only for account holders who judge; entries cannot conflict
	  themselves from being judged by an entire school's roster of judges
	  (because that is very rarely what is wanted).

	- Account holders can enter permanent conflicts against other account
	  holders for personal conflicts.  This only works for judges & entries
	  that are linked to an account; entries and judges not linked to accounts
	  will not have their conflicts carry over.


==CHANGES RELEASED 11.27.12==

	- Fixed the installer script to actually, y'know, work. 

	- The "Enter Ranks/Results" button on the Panel view will now allow the
	  tournament administrator to adjust ranks & results for debate, not just

	  showed information about IE competitors

	  CSV of a debate division's NDCA qualifying points. (Me. Yes, Me.)

	- Added a feature that allows judges to enter into two groups; you can
	  permit judges in one pool to count for another (for say a swing
	  tournament where one pool is Friday and the other Saturday). (Diablo
	  Valley)

	- Fixed an error where advancing into an elimination round in IE would not
	  permit you to advance into a round where there were no pre-set panels,
	  thus creating duplicate elim rounds etc.  (Maine, Jersey).

	- A circuit can now download its contact database into an Excel sheet on
	  the circuit management page off the homepage. (Mass)

	- Explained the event entry deadline a little better. (Everyone and their
	  uncle).

	- Added a "roundrobin" type for the Event Type.  Mostly useful for the CAT.

	- Added a "level" setting to the events; this is mostly going to be useful
	  for calculation of NDT points and won't be useful for others.

	- Adjust Labels now show reasonable defaults so if you change them and
	  break them you know how to put them back.  Amanda.

	  a judge roster.

	- Fixed a bug where hitting the back button after paneling the judges en
	  masse for a group would re-panel them.  Mayhem ensued in Maine.

	- The "Break Event" links on the ballot entry screen were broke.  Fixed
	  'em.

	- Printable listing of schools entered in a given division ( Entries ->
	  Events -> List Schools By Event on the right).

	  Reports -> onsite status)

	- Restored the paper ballot table checkin report (Vaughan).

	  able to go backwards and see past tournaments, right from their tabroom

	  however a bit slower as a result.

	- Fixed a bug where coach admins added by a site administrator were
	  prefs-only

	- Preference sheets will now cumulate ranks (If you rank fewer 3s you can
	  rate extra 2s, fewer 4s means extra 3s, etc) if the tournament setting
	  for it is enabled under Setup->Judges->Ratings.

==CHANGES RELEASED 10.31.12==
	
	Happy Halloween!

	- CAT API adapted to add minimum points, and to put placeholders in place
	  of null values because .NET throws a fit with nulls for some reason.

	- Unbalanced round tabs looked unselected; now they do not.

	- Fixed an issue where a multi-judge prelim panel would not show up for all

	  potential cross site scripting attack

	- Hi/Lo calculations on British Parliamentary are corrected

	- Judges were being assigned duplicate judge codes within a tournament;
	  this was preventing the next-judge function from working.  Fixed. (Sloat)

	  ampersands.  Fixed.

	- Changed About to Help/About on the front page 

	- Congress bill packets were not posting; fixed now. (Deveau)
