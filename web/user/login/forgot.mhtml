		<h4>Some things to remember...</h4>

		<ul>
	
			<li>
				Your tabroom.com account is tied to the email address you used
				when you first created it.  If you have changed your email
				address, try logging in with the old email.
			</li>

			<li>
				You can change your email address or password within
				tabroom.com by clicking on "Edit Profile" in the top right
				corner of the screen after you log in.
			</li>

			<li>
				Your password is case sensitive; be sure if you capitalized
				anything when you created it, you do so again.   However,
				emails are not case sensitive; upper and lower case do not
				matter.
			</li>

			<li>
				Cookies must be enabled on your browser for tabroom.com to work.
			</li>

			<li>
				If you cannot remember your password, or no longer have access
				to your original email account to get a reminder, or do not remember
				your email address, please email us at <% $Tab::admin_email %>. 
			</li>
