\chapter{Welcome to Tabroom}

Welcome to the tabroom.com system.  In addition to managing tournaments themselves, the tabroom system manages league websites and also will take care of registration for the entire season of forensics for you.    It will manage email lists and correspondence, allow you to post announcements, invitations and directions for tournaments, and maintain a record of dues payments and send invoices automatically to unpaid schools.
